Justify
=======

IntelliJ Plug-in to format text.

 Left or right justify columns of selected text. This makes it easy to format repetitive lines of code into easy
to read tables. *This only works when indenting with spaces, not tabs.*

To use:
------


1.  Select a rectangular block of text (alt-click and drag)
2. Choose *Left Justify* under the *Edit* menu. All the whitespace on the left is moved to the right.
3. Choose *Right Justify* under the *Edit* menu. All the whitespace on the right is moved to the left.
